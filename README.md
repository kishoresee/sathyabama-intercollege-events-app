# flutter_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
To run a Flutter project, follow these basic steps:

1. **Install Flutter and Dart SDK**:
   - Download and install the Flutter SDK from [Flutter's official website](https://flutter.dev).
   - Make sure to add Flutter to your system path.
   - The Dart SDK comes bundled with Flutter, so no need for a separate installation.

2. **Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**:
   - Use an IDE like **VS Code** or **Android Studio**.
   - Install the Flutter and Dart plugins/extensions for your chosen IDE.

3. **Set Up a Device**:
   - Use either an **emulator/simulator** (available in Android Studio or for iOS via Xcode on macOS) or a **physical device**.
   - For physical devices, enable **USB debugging** and connect it to your system.

4. **Open the Project**:
   - Open your Flutter project folder in your IDE.

5. **Check Flutter Setup**:
   - Open a terminal in your IDE and run:
     ```
     flutter doctor
     ```
   - Ensure there are no issues with your setup (e.g., connected device, Android licenses, or Flutter installations).

6. **Run the Flutter Project**:
   - In the terminal, navigate to your project directory if not already there and run:
     ```
     flutter pub get
     ```
   - This will fetch all the dependencies your project needs.
   - Then run:
     ```
     flutter run
     ```
   - The app should launch on the connected device or emulator. You can also use the “Run” button in your IDE for convenience.

This process will set up and run your Flutter project for development.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
